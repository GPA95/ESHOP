# E-SHOP
E-SHOP is a Grade 12 Python-based e-commerce project that includes product listing, user authentication, shopping cart functionality, and order processing. It integrates with an SQL database, showcasing Python programming concepts and database integration.

# Features
* User Authentication: Secure login and registration system.
* Product Management: Displays a list of products for browsing.
* Shopping Cart: Allows users to add, view, and remove items.
* Order Processing: Simulates the order checkout process.
* SQL Database Connectivity: Stores user details, product information, and transaction records in an SQL database.

# Technical Requirements
* Database: MySQL 8.0 Command Line Client
* Code Editor: Python IDLE (any version above 3.0)
* Programming Language: Python
* Python Libraries Used:
    * Pandas: To create Pandas Series and export CSV file
    * Matplotlib: To visualize the yearly sales of the online departmental store using a bar graph

# Project Report
https://github.com/GPA95/ESHOP/blob/main/IP%20PROJECT%202022-23.pdf

Our project report is also available for reference to further details, such as:
* SQL tables of the database
* Python program code
* All outputs of different cases

# Future Enhancements
Considering this project was made with only two years of academic knowledge about Python and MySQL, there are a few areas where the program can be further developed:
* The user-defined function customer() can be broken down into smaller functions for different sub-tasks to make the program more efficient and readable.
* Add payment gateway simulation.
* Expand product categories and enhance search functionality.
* Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
